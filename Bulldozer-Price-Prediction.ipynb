Problem defition\n","\n","> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?\n","\n","## 2. Data\n","\n","The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data\n","\n","There are 3 main datasets:\n","\n","* Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n","* Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.\n","* Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.\n","\n","## 3. Evaluation\n","\n","The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.\n","\n","For more on the evaluation of this project check: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation\n","\n","**Note:** The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error. For example, our goal for this project will be to build a machine learning model which minimises RMSLE.\n","\n","## 4. Features\n","\n","Kaggle provides a data dictionary detailing all of the features of the dataset. You can view this data dictionary on Google Sheets:
